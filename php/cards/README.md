# The French Leaf

Small card game to practice sessions in PHP. There are 52 cards divided into the 4 groups Clubs , Spades , Hearts
and Diamonds with 13 cards each.

Tested with PHP 7.4.15.

## TODO

At the moment only one player can play and draw 2 cards from the deck. I have to figure out if I can
implement a server-client model with sessions in PHP or if I have to use sockets.
